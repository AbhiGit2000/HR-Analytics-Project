💼 HR Analytics Project

🔍 Project Overview

This project explores employee attrition, promotions, and compensation patterns using a combination of SQL, Excel, and Power BI. The goal is to identify key HR challenges and provide data-driven recommendations to improve retention, fairness, and workforce planning.


📂 Dataset

The HR dataset is split into multiple CSV tables:

Employees Table – Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education

Jobs Table – Job role, Department, Level, Satisfaction, Tenure

Compensation Table – Salary, Salary hikes, Stock options, Overtime

Attrition Table – Attrition status, Promotions, Manager tenure, Training

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

SQL – Data cleaning, transformations, and analysis

Power BI – Dashboard creation, slicers, drill-throughs, bookmarks, and interactive visuals

Excel/CSV – Raw dataset handling


📊 Key Insights

Attrition Rate: Overall attrition rate is 16.12%

Roles at Risk: Sales Representatives and Lab Technicians show the highest attrition, linked to low pay & overtime

Promotion Gaps: Many Managers remain in the same role for 5+ years, indicating career stagnation

Compensation Inequities: Salary hikes and stock options are unevenly distributed across roles, with several high performers underpaid


💡 Recommendations

Compensation Strategy: Reevaluate salary hikes and extend stock options to underpaid but high-performing employees

Promotion Planning: Implement structured promotion cycles to prevent stagnation and improve retention

Overtime Policies: Review workload distribution in high-turnover roles to reduce burnout

Targeted Retention: Focus retention efforts on at-risk groups (Sales & Lab Techs) to cut attrition costs
