📊 HR Attrition Analytics Dashboard

🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes workforce data to uncover key drivers of employee attrition, compensation trends, job satisfaction levels, and employee demographics. The goal is to provide clear, actionable, data-driven insights that help HR teams improve employee retention and workforce planning strategies.

🗂️ Data Model

The analysis is built on four core tables linked using a common Employee Number key:

Employees – Demographics (Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education Field)

Jobs – Role, Department, Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, Years at Company

Compensation – Monthly Income, Stock Options, Overtime Status, Percent Salary Hike

Attrition – Attrition Flag, Years Since Promotion, Training History, Manager Tenure

This structured model enables consistent, filterable, and interactive analysis.
